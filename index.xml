      <description>Why Now my notes are all collected through Notion, I highly recommend it. But I think it may be also good to publish my notes somewhere 1. just in case 2. someone may find it helpful 3. Because I want to?
Who Anyone? Leave me your comments.
What I guess it will be mainly technical notes for now, I haven&amp;rsquo;t given a lot of thoughts of what to journal yet. So yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s random stuff.</description>
